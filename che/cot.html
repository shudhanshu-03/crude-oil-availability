                - Light Crude Oil: Also known as "sweet" crude oil, it has low density and low sulfur content. It is typically easier to refine and produces a higher yield of valuable products like gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel.
            </p>

            <p> 
                - Heavy Crude Oil: Also known as "sour" crude oil, it has a high density and high sulfur content. It is typically more difficult to refine and produces a lower yield of valuable products.
            </p>

            <p>  
                - Sour Crude Oil: This type of crude oil has a high sulfur content, which makes it more challenging to refine and produces more pollution during combustion.
            </p>

            <p>
                - Brent Crude Oil: This is a type of light, sweet crude oil that is produced in the North Sea. It is used as a benchmark for pricing crude oil internationally.
            </p>

            <p>
              - West Texas Intermediate (WTI): This is a type of light, sweet crude oil that is produced in the United States. It is also used as a benchmark for pricing crude oil.

            <p>
                - Canadian Oil Sands Crude: This is a type of heavy crude oil that is produced from oil sands in Canada. It requires more energy and resources to extract and refine, and it produces more greenhouse gas emissions than other types of crude oil.
