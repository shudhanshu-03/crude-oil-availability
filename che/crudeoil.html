                Crude oil is a finite resource that is extracted from the earth's crust. Its availability depends on a number of factors, including the size and quality of oil reserves, the level of exploration and production activity, and global demand for oil.
                Estimates of global oil reserves vary, but according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, there were about 1.7 trillion barrels of proven oil reserves worldwide as of the end of 2020. However, the amount of technically recoverable oil could be much higher.
                Currently, the world's largest oil producers are the United States, Saudi Arabia, and Russia. However, oil production is subject to fluctuations due to various factors, including natural disasters, geopolitical tensions, and changes in demand. The availability of crude oil also depends on the level of investment in the exploration and production of new reserves, which can be influenced by factors such as the price of oil and the availability of capital.
